# 🧠 Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) – AI & ML Internship

This project focuses on implementing **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to perform binary classification using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.
It explores both **linear** and **non-linear (RBF kernel)** classifiers, visualizes decision boundaries, and tunes hyperparameters using Grid Search with Cross-Validation.

## 📂 Overview

- ✅ Binary classification using Scikit-learn
- 🔍 Visual comparison of Linear vs RBF kernels
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- 📊 Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📈 Key Concepts

- Support Vectors & Margin Maximization
- Linear vs Non-Linear SVM
- Kernel Trick (RBF)
- Regularization (`C`) and Kernel Coefficient (`gamma`)
- Model Selection via Cross-Validation
